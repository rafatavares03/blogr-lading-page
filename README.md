## My process

### Built with

- [HTML](https://html.com/)
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html)
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)

### What I learned

With this project I learnd how to do a dropdown menu using only html and css, that z-index only work when the position is different than static, use svg images and I get better in position background images.

### Continued development

My JavaScript skills, and now I want to learn SASS because I take a long time to do the HTML and CSS, it would be cool for me learn some tool that would make this process a little more faster.
